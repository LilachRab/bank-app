# 🪙 BankApp

A simple money transaction web app built for learning and practice purposes.

## 📝 Description

BankApp is a simple web application that allows users to create an account, log in, send money to other users, view their transaction history, and log out.  
It was developed as a personal practice project after returning from maternity leave, to refresh and strengthen my development skills.

Both frontend and backend are implemented, though they have not yet been fully integrated or tested together.  
Future improvements include adding features such as real-time updates using Socket.IO, refining the codebase, fixing bugs, improving the frontend design, and enhancing overall functionality.
